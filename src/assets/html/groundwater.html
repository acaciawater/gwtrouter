<p>Groundwater is an important source of fresh water. Wells are used to access and
extract groundwater for drinking water, irrigation water or
industrial purposes. These wells come in different shapes and sizes,
each designed specifically for the location and the intended use.

Groundwater use can be explicit when new wells are
planned as part of the project. However, when mains water is largely
supplied by groundwater, projects using mains water should also be
taken into consideration here.
