<p>The rate at which groundwater is replenished is partly controlled
by the land cover. Areas with hard surfaces, like built up area,
prevent rain or surface water from reaching the groundwater. Wetland
and flooded areas, on the other hand, are usually characterized by
high groundwater recharge rates. Other land cover types like
cropland, grassland and bare surface fall in between these extremes. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a groundwater quantity perspective, higher replenishment
rates have a positive impact on groundwater resources due to the
higher availability. From a groundwater quality perspective, on the
other hand, higher replenishment rates increase the chance that
contaminants at the surface reach the groundwater. Therefore,
substantial changes in land cover type are important to assess
potential impacts on groundwater resources. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the purpose of this tool, we suggest any changes in land cover
larger than approximately 5 hectares (~12 acres) are relevant for the
risk assessment.</p>
