<p>The depth of the groundwater abstraction is related to the sustainability
of the water use and the likelihood of groundwater contamination.
Here, we distinguish two types of groundwater: shallow and deep
groundwater.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-US">Whether
groundwater is shallow or deep is not related to a specific depth.
Instead, we use the term shallow groundwater to describe the layer of
groundwater closest to the surface. When groundwater is divided into
different levels by layers of impermeable material, like clay, the
lower levels considered to be deep groundwater.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-US">Deep
groundwater may be plentiful, but is replenished much more slowly
than shallow groundwater. Therefore, deep groundwater is more
vulnerable to over-abstraction, where groundwater use is larger than
recharge. In addition, pumping costs are higher when water is
extracted from greater depths.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-US">Shallow
groundwater, on the other hand, is easier and cheaper to exploit. In
addition, it is more likely to be replenished, although this does
depend on the amount of rainfall and/or the availability of surface
water in the region. The main risk in using shallow groundwater is
that it is more vulnerable to contamination by human activities. </span>

information about which groundwater layer is being accessed is not
available, we suggest using a depth of 100&nbsp;meters (~300 feet) to
differentiate between deep and shallow groundwater.</span></p>
