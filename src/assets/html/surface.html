<p>The slower surface water moves, the greater the potential for surface
water to make its way to groundwater. While infrastructure or
measures that slow or store surface water have a positive effect on
groundwater availability, they also make groundwater more vulnerable
to any contaminants present in the surface water.

</p>
<p>Examples
of measures that slow or retain surface water include (check) dams,
infiltration ponds or reservoirs, irrigation channels and other
channel modifications.</p>
