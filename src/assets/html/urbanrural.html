<p>Groundwater is more likely to be of poor quality in urban areas than in rural
areas. The higher population density in urban areas increases the
risk of biological pollutants. In addition, industrial and domestic
waste are more concentrated. This means that it is extra important to
check groundwater quality when wells are planned in urban areas.
