<p>While natural causes are responsible for some contaminants in groundwater,
most groundwater contamination is caused by human activity. Waste
materials left untreated, either in solid or liquid form, can be
transported through the soil with rain or surface water to reach the
groundwater. In time, the concentration of contaminants may make the
groundwater unsuitable for use.</p>

<p>Waste
can be generated by different sectors. Domestic waste sources include
untreated waste water, sludge from waste water treatment plants, and
household waste. Agricultural waste includes fertilizers and
pesticides on the soil surface or in the water drained from fields.
Industrial waste can include wastewater, chemicals and oil.
