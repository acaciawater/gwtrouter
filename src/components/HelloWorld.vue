      <h1>Groundwater Impact Scan</h1>
      <p>Groundwater is by far the largest source of fresh water available for human use, providing drinking water, irrigation, and water for industrial purposes. This resource is particularly important in relatively dry regions where surface water is scarce.</p>
      <p>The demand for fresh water is increasing globally due to population growth and economic development. Based on the current increase in water demand, an estimated two-thirds of the global population will experience water scarcity by 2025. In light of the increasing water demand and climate change, it is crucial to ensure that groundwater resources are managed in a sustainable way.</p>
      <p>However, assessing the potential negative impacts a proposed project can have on groundwater resources is not straightforward. Part of the difficulty is that groundwater is not visible and tends to respond slowly to changes. The Groundwater Impact Scan (GRIS) has been developed to address this issue. The scan uses global data and project characteristics to evaluate project-specific threats related to groundwater resources.</p>
